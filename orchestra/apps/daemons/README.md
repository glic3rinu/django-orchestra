Daemons
=======

This application provides support for mapping services to server machines accross the network.

It supports _routing_ based on Python expression, which means that you can efectively
control services that are distributed accross several machines. For example, different
websites that are distributed accross _n_ web servers on a _shared hosting_
environment.
