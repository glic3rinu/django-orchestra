Emails
======

This app implements the basic functionality for managing the users, mailboxes and domains of
an email server.

[Postfix Virtual Domain Hosting](http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html) has been used
as a reference, however this application is compatible with most existing mail servers like
[Sendmail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail).
