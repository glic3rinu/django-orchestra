Emails
======

This app implements the basic functionality for managing users, mailboxes and domains of
an email server.

[Postfix Virtual Domain Hosting](http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html) has been used
as reference, however there is nothing in particular that stops this application to be fully 
compatible with any other existing mail server, like [Sendmail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail).
