System Users
============

This app implements the basic functionality for UNIX system users.


[/etc/passwd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd#Password_file) file database 
has been used as reference. However, there is nothing in particular that stops 
this application to be fully compatible with any other existing user databases or 
directories like [LDAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol).
