This Orchestra app models a web application. It provides all the common pieces
needed for a modern web application like **databases**, **system users** and **FTP accounts**.

The modeling of this application chooses simplicity over completeness; this app 
is developed with a **shared hosting** environment in mind, it will not be appropiate
for offering _database as a service_ or other complex services that need more
accurate service managament.
